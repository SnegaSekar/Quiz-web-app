This project presents a dynamic and interactive quiz web application designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application provides a user-friendly platform for users to test their knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions. Key features include navigation controls, allowing users to move between questions using "Previous" and "Next" buttons, and a countdown timer that limits the time to complete the quiz.
